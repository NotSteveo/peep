PEEP is a privacy-first website blocker that helps you stay focused by limiting distractions. Set delay timers, daily visit limits, and per-session caps with progressive delays that increase after each use. Site-specific rules, overlays, and popups enforce limits automaticallyâ€”without ever selling your data.
